# Graph Algorithms

## Breadth First Search

### Usage:
* In artificial intelligence / machine learning it can prove to be very important: robots can discover the surrounding more easily with BFS than DFS
* It is also very important in maximum flow: Edmonds-Karp algorithm uses BFS for finding augmenting paths
* In garbage collecting
* Serialization - deserialization of a tree like structures

## Depth First Search
### Usage:
* Topological ordering
* Detecting cycles
* Generating mazes or finding way out of a maze
